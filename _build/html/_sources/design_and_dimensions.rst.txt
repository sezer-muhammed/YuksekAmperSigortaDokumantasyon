Design and Dimensions
=====================

Design
------

The High Current Emergency Stop Switch boasts a simple and compact design, making it suitable for a wide range of electronic applications. It has been designed to be robust, reliable, and capable of handling high current loads in a variety of conditions without loss of input voltage.

The switch features a linear rail system, ensuring durability and longevity.

Dimensions
----------

The High Current Emergency Switch measures 43mm in length, 43mm in width, and 59mm in height. This compact size allows it to be easily incorporated into a variety of systems without taking up much space.

The switch weighs less than 50 grams, making it lightweight yet sturdy. The quick and easy connection facilitated by the M3 connectors, along with the ability to directly fit into the appropriate hole, further contribute to its versatility and ease of use.

Mounting
--------

The switch can be mounted using the M3 connectors, providing a quick and easy installation process. This design allows for secure attachment to your robotic system. Furthermore, the switch can be directly fitted into the appropriate hole, enhancing its mounting flexibility and ensuring a sturdy connection.

Connections
-----------

The switch is designed to connect to your system via two XT60 outputs. These connections are designed to handle high currents, supporting continuous currents up to 120 amperes and burst currents up to 240 amperes without any heat or voltage loss. This ensures reliable, uninterrupted operation. Users can solder their own circuit to these outputs. In addition, the switch is equipped with a safety mechanism that prevents short-circuiting when the button is pressed.

This versatile and user-friendly design, combined with its robust construction, makes ORION Robotics new product, High Current Emergency Stop Switch a valuable addition to any electronics project, enhancing safety and performance.
